# Conways-Life
This is a simulator for Conway's Game of Life. It was written in the LOVE framework for Lua. There is a Windows Executable file, as well as the source code. The rules of the game can also be modified from the default. There is an Easter Egg hidden within the game. Can you find it?\
Lua is an excellent programming language. Its website is here: https://www.lua.org
